# temperature_calculator
This is a simple JavaScript program which will convert celsius, kelvin or fahrenheit to celsius, kelvin or fahrenheit. First the program asks what temperature you are converting from, asks the degree, then asks what form of temperature you'd like to convert to. Once those questions are answered you'll get the coversion.
